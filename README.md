# jrnl

A small program to help write a personal journal. At present, just opens
up current entries; but more to come soon.

Right now you're constrained to having a journal structure like so:

root/  
root/2017/  
root/2017/2017-07-05.txt  
root/2017/2017-09-01.txt

## How to install?

```
sudo pip3 install jrnl-mw
```
