# jrnl

A small program to help write a personal journal. At present, doesn't do
too much; but more to come soon.

Right now you're constrained to having a journal structure like so:

```
journal_root/
journal_root/2017/
journal_root/2017/2017-07-05.txt
journal_root/2017/2017-09-01.txt
```

and if you want to use all the features you're going to need to be okay
with ISO 8601-based timestamps:

```
2017-09-01
21:06

You'd write stuff here.

22:30

And more stuff here.
```

## How to install?

```
sudo pip3 install jrnl-mw
```
